# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Keipher Alaniz and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Engineering.

## Computer Science Projects

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I love gambling. I like to test my chances and not break the limit. I was able to write functions for the first time that 
    calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt. I was also able to assigning cards to their respective integers.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I wrote a code that uses variables, initialization, arithmetic operators, input, output, and functions. This was the very
    beginning of when I actually started coding. This lab introduced me to all of the basics of C++.

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite because that is when I put my knowledge of c out. I learned how to effectively translate text through files. I also liked writing code 
    that handles I/O errors because that would be one less problem for my future projects.
